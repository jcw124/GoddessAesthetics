# Require Install
Require install enable you to automatically install packages when you require them. Very usefull for keeping your productivity high.

There is no performance lost (other than loading this package of course) because require-install at very first tries to require() your package the usual way.

## Installation
Global
```bash
npm install -g require-install
```
or local
```bash
npm install --save require-install
```

## Usage
```javascript
var require_install = require('require-install');

// Just replace your require() with require_install():
var the_package = require_install('the-package');

// If it can't require it, it will install it and add it to your dependencies

the_package.doSomething();
```

## Specific version
When a package is not available it will install the package according to the ./package.json. It will look up the version number if it exists. Else it will just install the latest and add it to the dependencies.

### Silence!
If you wish to require-install packages without output, add the following to your package.json:
```json
"require-install": {
    "silent": true
}
```
